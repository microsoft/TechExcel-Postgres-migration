## Task 01: Using pattern matching for queries

Weâ€™ll explore how to use the **ILIKE** clause in SQL to perform case-insensitive searches within text fields. This approach can help Metropolis officials locate specific complaints or requests in large datasets without having to rely on exact phrasing.

1. Search for cases mentioning **Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above** by entering the following query in pgAdmin, then select **Execute script**.

    ```sql
    SELECT id, name, opinion
    FROM cases
    WHERE opinion ILIKE '%Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above';
    ```

    {: .note }
    > There are no results as the exact words are not mentioned in the opinion. We'll need to try another approach.
