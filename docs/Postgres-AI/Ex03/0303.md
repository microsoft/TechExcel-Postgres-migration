## Task 03: What is GraphRAG

GraphRAG uses knowledge graphs to provide substantial improvements in question-and-answer performance when reasoning about complex information. A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that captures relationships between entities in a graph format. It’s used to integrate, manage, and query data from diverse sources, providing a unified view of interconnected data. 
For municipal operations, this approach helps identify dependencies or legal precedents across different agencies or departments.

[Apache Graph Extension](https://age.apache.org/age-manual/master/index.html) (AGE) is a PostgreSQL extension developed under the Apache Incubator project. AGE is designed to provide graph database functionality, enabling users to store and query graph data efficiently within PostgreSQL.

### Understanding improved accuracy of GraphRAG

Using the same example from the vector search example in the previous section,  follow these instructions to explore the accuracy of the semantic reranker:

1. Open your browser back to the RAG application tab, or go to: https://abeomorogbe-graphra-ca.gentledune-632d42cd.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io

1. Select **GraphRAG + Semantic Ranker** on the top bar, then select **Clear** in the upper right, if needed, to go back to the home screen.

1. Select **Water leaking into the apartment** from the example queries.

1. Select the **Show graph** icon in the upper right of the prompt's response to see which cases were used to answer the question.

1. On the **Citation Graph**, note the semantic reranker has an improved accuracy, retrieving 70% of the most relevant cases.

### How to implement graph queries for GraphRAG

1. Open the **pgAdmin** window.

1. Before we execute the graph query to improve the relevance of your search results, it’s important to understand the following snippet of code for reranking.

    {: .note }
    > This performs the following actions:
    > - Selects the **refs** (reference count) and **case_id** from the **graph** (created with [Apache Age extension](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/introducing-support-for-graph-data-in-azure-database-for-postgresql-preview/4275628)).
    - Selects all columns from the **semantic_ranked** table.
    - Performs a **LEFT JOIN** between **semantic_ranked** and the result of a Cypher query executed on the case_graph graph.
    - The Cypher query matches all relationships (**[r]**) and returns the case_id and the count of references (**refs**) for each node (**n**).
    - The join condition matches the **id** from **semantic_ranked** with the **case_id** from the Cypher query result, casting **case_id** to an integer.

1. Select the **New query tool for current connection** button on the top of the query pane. 

    We’ve created two files for you to test graph queries. One to set up the graph and the other to run the query. 

    ![m2sphzrm.jpg](../media/m2sphzrm.jpg)

1. Select the **Open File** button.

    ![Open file in pgAdmin](../media/open-file.png)

1. Go to **C:\Users\LabUser\Downloads\mslearn-pg-ai\Setup\SQLScript**, select **graph_setup**, then select **Open** on the lower right.

1. Select the **Execute script** button on the toolbar. 

1. Select the **New query tool for current connection** button again. 

1. Select **Open File**. 

1. In **C:\Users\LabUser\Downloads\mslearn-pg-ai\Setup\SQLScript**, select **graph_query**, then select **Open** on the lower right.

1. Select **Execute script**. 

{: .warning }
> If you receive an error in the output, try executing again.

The output will be similar to the following:
