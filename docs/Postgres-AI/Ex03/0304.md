## Task 04: Compare Results of RAG responses using Vector search, Reranker or GraphRAG

As you look through these results, consider the following aspects while comparing them:

- Accuracy: Which query returns more relevant results?
- Understandability: Which response is easier to comprehend and more user-friendly?

Evaluate which query approach yields more relevant results, factoring in accuracy, clarity, and user-friendliness. Determining the best method helps Metropolis optimize data retrieval and resolution workflows.

1. Open your browser back to the RAG application tab, or go to: **https://abeomorogbe-graphra-ca.gentledune-632d42cd.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io**

1. Select **Vector** on the top bar, then select **Clear** in the upper right, if needed, to go back to the home screen.

1. Select **Water leaking into the apartment** from the example queries.

1. Select the **Show graph** icon in the upper right of the prompt's response to see which cases were used to answer the question. 

1. Repeat the steps for **Semantic Ranker** and **GraphRAG + Semantic Ranker** on the top bar.

As you implement more advanced techniques, youâ€™ll get better accuracy for different scenarios.
