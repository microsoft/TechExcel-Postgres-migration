## Task 02: Improving RAG accuracy with advanced techniques - Reranking and GraphRAG

### What is a reranker?

A reranker is a system or algorithm used to improve the relevance of search results. It takes an initial set of results generated by a primary search algorithm and reorders them based on additional criteria or more sophisticated models. The goal of reranking is to enhance the quality and relevance of the results presented to the user, often by leveraging machine learning models that consider various factors such as user behavior, contextual information, and advanced relevance scoring techniques.

### Understanding improved accuracy of semantic reranker

We’ll use the same example from the vector search example in the previous section. To explore the accuracy of the semantic reranker, follow these instructions:

1. On the RAG application, select **Semantic Ranker** on the top bar, then select **Clear** in the upper right to go back to the home screen.

1. Select the same **Water leaking into the apartment** query from the previous task.

1. Select the **Show graph** icon in the upper right of the prompt's response to see which cases were used to answer the question.

1. On the **Citation Graph**, note the semantic reranker has an improved accuracy, retrieving 60% of the most relevant cases.

### How to implement a reranker for queries

1. Open the **pgAdmin** window for the following steps.

1. Before we execute the reranker query to improve the relevance of your search results, it’s important to understand the following snippet of code for reranking. 

    {: .warning }
    > Do not run this code, as it's solely for demonstration.

    {: .note }
    > The above snippet performs the following actions:
    - **azure_ml.invoke()** - Invokes the Azure Machine Learning service with the specified deployment name and timeout. [BGE model](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) is being used for reranker.
    - **jsonb_array_elements()** - Processes the JSON payload and extracts the relevance score and ordinality for each element to improve the relevance of search results.
    - **elem.relevance**- The relevance is used for reranking the results.

1. Select the **New query tool for current connection** button on the top of the query pane.

    We’ve created a file for you to test reranking. 

    ![m2sphzrm.jpg](../media/m2sphzrm.jpg)

1. Select the **Open File** button.

    ![Open file in pgAdmin](../media/open-file.png)

1. Go to **C:\Users\LabUser\Downloads\mslearn-pg-ai\Setup\SQLScript**, select **reranker_query**, then select **Open** on the lower right.

1. Note that the API Key is currently empty on **Line 3**. Replace the line with the following:

    ```
    select azure_ai.set_setting('azure_ml.endpoint_key', 'MHAL0tpPSSk0Z5xW40WyuXkW9h6QAjuu');
    ```

1. Ensure no lines of text are highlighted in the code, then select the **Execute script** button on the top bar.

    The output will be similar to the following:
