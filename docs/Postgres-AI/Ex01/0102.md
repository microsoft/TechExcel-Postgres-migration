## Task 02: Connect to your database using psql in the Azure Cloud Shell

Municipal IT teams often work in varied environments. Using the Azure Cloud Shell ensures secure, consistent access to PostgreSQL resources without requiring local installations or complex VPN setups.
In this task, youâ€™ll connect to the **cases** database on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server using the [psql command-line utility](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) from the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

1. In the Azure portal, under the **Navigate** section, select **Resource Groups**

1. On the **Open New Cloud Shell** dialog, select **Continue**. You will not lose the previously cloned content.

1. At the **Password for user pgAdmin** prompt in the Cloud Shell, enter the password for the **pgAdmin** sign in.

    {: .warning }
    The text cursor for password entry does not move as you type.

    > Password: **passw0rd**

    Once signed in, the **psql** prompt for the **cases** database is displayed.
