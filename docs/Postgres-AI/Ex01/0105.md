## Task 05: Install and configure the azure_ai extension

For advanced data processing, Metropolis must integrate Azure AI services directly within PostgreSQL. The azure_ai extension allows seamless interaction with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services.
In this task, you will install the **azure_ai** extension into your database and set up connections to your Azure AI Services resources. Doing so enables direct communication for automated text analysis, summarizations, and more.

{: .note }
> You'll use **pgAdmin** for the following steps.

<!--Before using the **azure_ai** extension, you must install it into your database and configure it to connect to your Azure AI Services resources. The **azure_ai** extension allows you to integrate the Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services into your database. -->

{: .important }
> Before an extension can be installed and used in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database, it must be added to the server's **allowlist**, as described in [how to use PostgreSQL extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions).

To enable the extension in your database, follow these steps:

1. Enter the following command in the pgAdmin **Query** pane. 

    ```
    SHOW azure.extensions;
    ```

    {: .note }
    > This verifies the **azure_ai**, **vector**, **age** and **pg_diskann** extensions were successfully added to your server's **allowlist** by the Bicep deployment script that ran when setting up your environment.

1. Select the **Execute script** button.

1. Install the **azure_ai** extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command. Overwrite the previous query used with the following:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS azure_ai;
    ```

{: .important }
> **CREATE EXTENSION** loads a new extension into the database by running its script file. This script typically creates new SQL objects such as functions, data types, and schemas. An error is thrown if an extension of the same name already exists. Adding **IF NOT EXISTS** allows the command to execute without throwing an error if itâ€™s already installed.
