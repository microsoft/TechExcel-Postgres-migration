## Task 03: Populate the database with sample data and explore

Before configuring AI services, the City of Metropolis needs relevant test data. By creating tables and inserting sample records, officials can validate the AI features on realistic data (e.g., legal cases or citizen service requests).
In this task, you will add a couple of tables to the **cases** database and populate them with sample data so you have information to work with as you review the extension's functionality.

1. Run the following commands to create the **cases** tables for storing law cases data:

    ```
    \i mslearn-pg-ai/Setup/SQLScript/initialize_dataset.sql;
    ```

1. Enter the following command to allow the extended display to be automatically applied:

    ```
    \x auto
    ```

    {: .important }
    >Enabling the extended display for query results in psql improves the readability of output for subsequent commands. 

1. Retrieve a sample of data from the **cases** table. This allows us to examine the structure and content of the data stored in the database.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM cases
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
