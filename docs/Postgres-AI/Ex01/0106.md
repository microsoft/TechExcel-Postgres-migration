## Task 06: Explore the Azure AI schema
 Metropolis’s IT department needs to understand how AI services function within PostgreSQL to effectively manage user queries and automate tasks.

The **azure_ai** schema provides the framework for directly interacting with Azure AI and ML services from your database. It contains functions for setting up connections to those services and retrieving them from the **settings** table, also hosted in the same schema. The **settings** table provides secure storage in the database for endpoints and keys associated with your Azure AI and ML services.

> Review the schema: [Configure the azure_ai extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-overview#configure-the-azure_ai-extension)

- Review the functions defined in the **azure_ai** schema. 

         Schema |  Name  | Result data type | Argument data types | Type 
        ----------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|------
         azure_ai | get_setting | text      | key text      | func
         azure_ai | set_setting | void      | key text, value text | func
         azure_ai | version  | text      |           | func

{: .important }
> Because the connection information for Azure AI services, including API keys, is stored in a configuration table in the database, the **azure_ai** extension defines a role called **azure_ai_settings_manager** to ensure this information is protected and accessible only to users who have been assigned that role. This role enables reading and writing of settings related to the extension.

### Exploring the Azure AI functions

Only members of the **azure_ai_settings_manager** role can invoke the **azure_ai.get_setting()** and **azure_ai.set_setting()** functions. In an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, all admin users (those with the **azure_pg_admin**</code> role assigned) are also assigned the **azure_ai_settings_manager**</code> role.

Once these settings are properly configured, Metropolis can quickly integrate cognitive services—for example, to process lengthy legal documents or citizen requests—directly in its database.

To demonstrate how you use the **azure_ai.set_setting()**</code> and **azure_ai.get_setting()**</code> functions, configure the connection with your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. Go to the tab where Cloud Shell is open, minimize the Cloud Shell pane, then select the **ResourceGroup1** breadcrumb link.

1. Select the **Azure OpenAI** resource.

    ![jo30kfup.jpg](../media/jo30kfup.jpg)

1. On the Azure OpenAI resource page, in the service menu, under the **Resource Management** section, select **Keys and Endpoint**.

1. Enter the value for **KEY 1** in the below textbox:

    `@lab.TextBox(API_KEY)`

1. Enter the value for **Endpoint**:

    `@lab.TextBox(ENDPOINT)`

    ![Screenshot of the Azure OpenAI service's Keys and Endpoints page is displayed, with the KEY 1 and Endpoint copy buttons highlighted by red boxes.](./instructions282962/azure-openai-keys-and-endpoints.png)

    {: .important }
    > You can use either **KEY 1** or **KEY 2**. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing service disruption.

1. Once you have your endpoint and key, maximize the **pgAdmin** window.

1. Enter the following in the **Query** pane to add your values to the configuration table:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint', '@lab.Variable(ENDPOINT)');
    SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', '@lab.Variable(API_KEY)');
    ```

    {: .warning }
    > This code block uses your input from the above text boxes for **KEY 1** and **Endpoint**. 

1. Select the **Execute script** button on the toolbar. The input and output should look similar to the following.

    ![ew9kd8ez.jpg](../media/ew9kd8ez.jpg)

1. Verify the settings were written into the **azure_ai.settings** table. Enter the following, then select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.endpoint');
    ```

1. Enter the following, then select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key');
    ```

    ![h9dxoetd.jpg](../media/h9dxoetd.jpg)

    The **azure_ai** extension is now connected to your Azure OpenAI account.

### Review the Azure OpenAI schema

The **azure_openai** schema provides the ability to integrate the creation of vector embedding of text values into your database using Azure OpenAI. Using this schema, you can [generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) directly from the database to create vector representations of input text, which can then be used in vector similarity searches, as well as consumed by machine learning models. 

The schema contains a single function, **create_embeddings()**</code>, with two overloads. One overload accepts a single input string, and the other expects an array of input strings.

Review the details of the functions in the **azure_openai**</code> schema: [Configure OpenAI endpoint and key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-openai#configure-openai-endpoint-and-key)

The documentation shows the two overloads of the **azure_openai.create_embeddings()**</code> function, allowing you to review the differences between the two versions of the function and the types they return. 

1. Enter the following query and select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Sample text for PostgreSQL Lab') AS vector;
    ```

    ![3204fmnv.jpg](../media/3204fmnv.jpg)

    {: .note }
    > This is a simplified example of using the function, creating a vector embedding for a sample query. The **deployment_name**</code> parameter is set to **embedding**</code>, which is the name of the deployment of the **text-embedding-3-small**</code> model in your Azure OpenAI service. 


{: .important }
>[Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#embeddings) are a concept in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) that involves representing objects such as words, documents, or entities, as [vectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#vectors) in a multi-dimensional space.
>
> Embeddings allow machine learning models to evaluate how closely two pieces of information are related. This technique efficiently identifies relationships and similarities between data, allowing algorithms to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.
>
> The **azure_ai**</code> extension allows you to generate embeddings for input text. To enable the generated vectors to be stored alongside the rest of your data in the database, you must install and [enable the vector extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-use-pgvector#enable-extension). However, that’s outside the scope of this exercise.
