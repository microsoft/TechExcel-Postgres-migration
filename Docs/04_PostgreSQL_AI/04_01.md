# Task 01: Getting started with AI on Azure PostgreSQL flexible server 

## Introduction

TBD need intro 

## Description

In this task, you’ll establish a foundation for AI-driven database operations in Azure PostgreSQL. You will clone the necessary lab files, connect to your cases database using both the Azure Cloud Shell and pgAdmin, and install the azure_ai extension for direct integration with Azure AI services. This setup mirrors the City of Metropolis’s approach to modernizing public services through robust data handling and advanced analytics.

##### Connection Instructions 

1. Sign in to the virtual machine with the following credentials:

    | Item | Value |
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username   | **@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base-VM).Username**   |
    | Password  | **@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base-VM).Password**   |

    {: .highlight }
    > Select the **Type Text** icon to enter the associated text into the virtual machine. 


##### Task 01: Clone TechConnect lab repo

The City of Metropolis relies on standardized scripts and templates to manage its data environment. By cloning the TechConnect lab repository, you ensure that everyone follows the same procedures when deploying AI features.
In this task, you will clone the TechConnect lab repository, which contains the scripts and configuration files needed to configure AI features within an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server environment.

1. Open a browser, go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), then sign in with your lab credentials:

    | Item | Value |
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username   | @lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username   |
    | Password  | @lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password   |

1. Select the **Cloud Shell** icon in Azure's global controls to open a new [Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview) pane.

1. At the Cloud Shell prompt, enter the following to clone the GitHub repo containing exercise resources:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mslearn-pg-ai.git
    ```

Municipal IT teams often work in varied environments. Using the Azure Cloud Shell ensures secure, consistent access to PostgreSQL resources without requiring local installations or complex VPN setups.
In this task, you’ll connect to the **cases** database on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server using the [psql command-line utility](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) from the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

1. In the Azure portal, under the **Navigate** section, select **Resource Groups**

    ![s20lnz6l.jpg](../media/s20lnz6l.jpg)

1. Select **ResourceGroup1**.
    
1. In the resource group, select the pre-deployed **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** resource.

    {: .warning }
    > It may take 5-10 minutes to start and finish deploying.

    ![u4fenkqc.jpg](../media/u4fenkqc.jpg)

1. In the left service menu, under **Settings**, select **Databases**

1. Select **Connect** to the right of the **cases** database.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Databases page. Databases and Connect for the cases database are highlighted by red boxes.](../media/postgresql-cases-database-connect.png)

1. On the **Open New Cloud Shell** dialog, select **Continue**. You will not lose the previously cloned content.

1. At the **Password for user pgAdmin** prompt in the Cloud Shell, enter the password for the **pgAdmin** sign in.

    {: .warning }
    The text cursor for password entry does not move as you type.

    > Password: **passw0rd**

    Once signed in, the **psql** prompt for the **cases** database is displayed.

1. You'll continue working in the Cloud Shell throughout the remainder of this exercise, so it may be helpful to select the **Maximize** button at the upper right of the pane.
