# Task 01: Getting started with AI on Azure PostgreSQL flexible server 

## Introduction

TBD need intro 

## Description

In this task, you’ll establish a foundation for AI-driven database operations in Azure PostgreSQL. You will clone the necessary lab files, connect to your cases database using both the Azure Cloud Shell and pgAdmin, and install the azure_ai extension for direct integration with Azure AI services. This setup mirrors the City of Metropolis’s approach to modernizing public services through robust data handling and advanced analytics.

##### Task 01: Clone TechConnect lab repo

The City of Metropolis relies on standardized scripts and templates to manage its data environment. By cloning the TechConnect lab repository, you ensure that everyone follows the same procedures when deploying AI features.
In this task, you will clone the TechConnect lab repository, which contains the scripts and configuration files needed to configure AI features within an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server environment.

1. Open a browser, go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), then sign in with your lab credentials:

    | Item | Value |
    |:--------|:--------|
    | Username   | @lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username   |
    | Password  | @lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password   |

1. Select the **Cloud Shell** icon in Azure's global controls to open a new [Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview) pane.
