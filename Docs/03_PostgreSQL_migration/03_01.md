# Task 01: Create Azure resources (TBD minutes)

## Introduction 

Creating a secure and well-structured cloud environment is critical for the City of Metropolis’s database migration efforts. By setting up an Azure virtual network, the city ensures that its PostgreSQL database is isolated from unauthorized access, aligning with security best practices. A virtual network gateway provides a secure and reliable connection between on-premises systems and Azure, supporting seamless data migration. Additionally, deploying an Azure Database for PostgreSQL within this controlled environment ensures scalability, reliability, and compliance with modern data management standards. These foundational steps enable the city to enhance public service operations while maintaining strong data security and performance.

## Description 

In this task, you establish the core infrastructure for migrating the City of Metropolis’s PostgreSQL database to Azure. You start by creating an Azure virtual network to isolate and protect database traffic. Then, you create a virtual network gateway to establish a secure connection between the on-premises environment and Azure. You also configure security certificates and set up a point-to-site VPN connection to ensure encrypted data transmission. Finally, you deploy an Azure Database for PostgreSQL within this secured network. This setup mirrors real-world enterprise environments where security, connectivity, and scalability are essential for cloud-based database operations.

## Success Criteria 

- You successfully created a virtual network in Azure with the required subnet configuration.
- You created a virtual network gateway to enable secure connections.
- You successfully generated and configured security certificates for authentication.
- You established a point-to-site VPN connection between the on-premises network and Azure.
- You successfully created an Azure Database for PostgreSQL and confirmed connectivity within the virtual network.
